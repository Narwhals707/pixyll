    <td>I learned by doing the provided exercises on Codecademy. I found them to be really helpful, because they tell you what you're doing wrong, but don’t give you the answer. I also spent a bit of time helping other people, which I found slightly beneficial, because it helped me revise things which I’ve already done. Another bonus of helping other people is that they’re more likely to help you if you’re stuck. However, I think the exercises still help you more than other people do for the most part.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I have no evidence that I got to Chapter 4 as I didn’t take screenshots of the badges I obtained this week. I do need to do that as I continue with this course. I found the course helpful and easy to follow, and I didn’t get stuck on any of the questions, and, more importantly, I didn’t need to skip any questions. I feel that skipping a question won’t benefit you in the long run so I need to refrain from skipping if I get stuck.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will make sure to record my progress by taking screenshots of the badges I obtain and saving them to my Drive. I also need to make a blog post and paste the badges into it to prove that I have done this much. On the other hand, I think that that there isn’t much I need to change about my pace of work; I can say with certainty that I will finish the course on time at this rate. I reached 19% at the end of the lesson.</td>
