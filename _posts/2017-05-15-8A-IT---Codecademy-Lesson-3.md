    <td>There wasn't anything new I did in the way of learning, but I did learn a lot of new things about Python. I think the course itself is the most effective thing because it incorporates code which we have already learned, overviews, mini tests and what to expect. However, sometimes working on a question on the course for too long is a bit frustrating, and taking a break from the exercise by helping somebody else may give me a fresh perspective. If this doesn’t work, I found out that the Q&A Forum is the next best thing, and often answers your questions nicely.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work slower as I found myself misspelling wors oftenn which took up more time than slowing down and taking my time. On the other hand, I also need to make sure that I don’t work too slowly so that I can actually get through the work in the end. Overall, I think that this is nitpicking at this point, and I am happy with what I am covering in the course.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I will slow down my work so that I don’t misspell things as often, and I have a chance to reflect on what I have learned (and memorise it). Hopefully I will be able to stop using the Q&A Forum by next lesson. I think that learning another language for coding may help me with the order of events, but not with the actual vocabulary. I don’t think I should do that now though, as it might confuse me, but it might be a good idea later once I’ve nailed the vocab.</td>
